## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Security & Access
- **Robust Authentication:** JWT-based sessions with HTTP-only, secure cookies.
- **Anti-Brute Force:** Rate limiting applied to logins and API interactions.
- **Strict Passwords:** Enforced policy (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers).
- **Audit Logging:** Logs all login attempts (Success/Fail, IP, User-Agent).

### 📡 Inbound Management
- **Full Lifecycle:** Create, edit, toggle, and safely delete VLESS configs.
- **Granular Control:** Per-user traffic limits (GB), expiration days, and max concurrent connections.
- **Advanced Routing:** Custom Path, SNI, Host, and TLS Fingerprints per inbound.
- **Bulk Operations:** Batch activate, deactivate, reset, or delete configs.
- **Immutable Core:** The default `SulgX` inbound is systematically protected against accidental deletion.

### 📊 Real-Time Analytics
- **Live Speed Engine:** Highly accurate Download/Upload charts with adaptive spike-filtering.
- **Dynamic Metrics:** 24-hour real-time traffic bars (timezone-aware) and distribution doughnuts.
- **System Health:** Live CPU, Memory, and Disk monitoring with `loadavg` fallbacks.

### 🗺️ Clean IP & Safe Scanner
- **IP Management:** Add, edit, and bulk-import IPv4/IPv6 addresses dynamically attached to subscriptions.
- **Safe Scanner:** Scan port 443 across 24 predefined cloud providers (Cloudflare, AWS, Azure, etc.).
- **Anti-Crash:** Safely handles massive CIDR ranges (e.g., `/14`) by capping at 4,096 IPs to prevent browser freezing. Automatically excludes public DNS (8.8.8.8).

### 🤖 Smart Telegram Bot
- **Bilingual (EN/FA):** Fully translatable templates.
- **Event Alerts:** Panel Logins, Expired Users, Errors, and 90% Quota warnings.
- **Live Preview:** Real-time JSON template rendering in the dashboard.

## 📁 Repository Architecture

The repository is kept intentionally minimal. Everything required for production is included:

| File | Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `main.py` | **Core** | The beating heart of V2X. Contains FastAPI backend, WebSocket tunnels, and embedded HTML/JS frontend. |
| `requirements.txt` | **Config** | Strictly pinned Python dependencies ensuring build stability. |
| `Procfile` | **Deploy** | Standardized startup instructions for Heroku, Railway, and Render. |
| `render.yaml` | **Deploy** | Infrastructure-as-Code blueprint for instant 1-click deployments on Render. |
| `v2x-config.toml` | **Docs** | Reference guide containing the required Environment Variables for manual setups. |
| `.gitignore` | **Git** | Keeps the repository clean by excluding logs, caches, and local `.db` files. |

## 🚀 Quick Start & Deployment

> [!NOTE]
> V2X will run on *any* platform that supports ASGI Python applications (Uvicorn/Gunicorn) and standard WebSocket connections.

### 1. Configure Environment Variables
You must set the following Environment Variables in your provider's dashboard:

| Variable | Example Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `StrongPass!123` | Required for panel access. (Min 8 chars, mixed case, numbers). |
| `SECRET_KEY` | `random_long_string` | Used for securing JWT login cookies. |
| `DOMAIN` | `v2x.up.railway.app` | Your public domain. *Highly recommended for accurate link generation.* |
| `DB_PATH` | `/tmp/panel.db` | Where the SQLite DB is stored. Use `/data/panel.db` if using persistent volumes. |

### 2. Start Command
Use this exact command on all platforms (if required manually):
```bash
gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT

```
